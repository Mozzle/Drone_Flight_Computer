### In this project, I hope to design a quadcopter drone in Fusion 360, as well as create an ESP32 powered flight computer, fitted with 6-axis gyroscope/accelerometer, barometer, and potentially other features. I intend to write this computer with minimal additional libraries, writing drivers for the gyroscope and barometer myself.
